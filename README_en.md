# HiFiShifter

[简体中文](README.md) | [繁體中文](README_zh-TW.md) | [English](README_en.md) | [日本語](README_ja.md) | [한국어](README_ko.md)

HiFiShifter is a graphical vocal editing and synthesis tool. It supports multi-track audio clip processing and uses various vocoders to achieve pitch correction and parameter adjustment for human voice, integrating splicing and tuning for human VOCALOID production.

**The project is still under active development. Full-chain testing has not been completed, so there may be many bugs or instability issues.**

## Installation

Download and install the appropriate release version for your system from the sidebar of the repository.

## Basic Principle

HiFiShifter uses an offline rendering approach similar to UTAU, processing, rendering, and caching each audio clip on the timeline before feeding it into the playback system, resulting in faster processing for short clips.

HiFiShifter provides a unified rendering interface to facilitate future algorithm additions.

## Recommended Workflow

Our recommended workflow is:

1. Prepare short clip sources needed for human voice using other DAWs or slicing software.
2. Complete audio splicing and tuning in HiFiShifter.

HiFiShifter also supports the following operations to facilitate migration from other software:

1. Directly open VocalShifter projects.
2. Directly open Reaper projects.
3. Parse VocalShifter clipboard content, allowing parameters from VocalShifter to be pasted into HiFiShifter's parameter area.
4. Parse Reaper clipboard content, allowing Reaper items to be pasted directly into HiFiShifter.

## Feature Introduction

### Layout

HiFiShifter can be roughly divided into two functional areas: the upper track panel and the lower parameter panel. The track panel is mainly responsible for audio clip processing, while the parameter panel handles parameter adjustments.

### Track Panel

HiFiShifter provides a fairly complete track panel and audio clip editing functionality, similar to most modern DAWs.

#### Importing Audio

HiFiShifter supports three ways to import audio:

1. Drag and drop audio from the system file manager directly onto a track.
2. Click the folder icon on the toolbar to open the built-in file browser and drag audio onto a track.
3. Press `Ctrl + F` to open quick search, select audio, and import it onto a track (the quick search file path matches the built-in file browser's current path).

#### Audio Editing

- **Snap to Grid**: Clip movement/cropping snaps to grid by default; hold `Shift` to temporarily disable snap.
- **Crop/Stretch Range**: Drag the left/right edges of a clip to crop or extend.
- **Time Stretch**: Hold `Alt` + left mouse button and drag the left/right edges of a clip to stretch the audio.
- **Slip-Edit**: Hold `Alt` + left mouse button and drag the main body of a clip to slide its internal content left or right.
- **Fade In/Out**: Drag the top-left/top-right corner of a clip to adjust fade in/out duration.
- **Gain (dB)**: Drag the knob at the top-left of a clip (up/down) to adjust gain; the current dB is displayed at the top-right.
- **Clip Mute (M)**: Click the `M` button at the top-left of a clip to mute it; the clip will turn grey.
- **Marquee Select**: Hold the right mouse button and drag in an empty area of the timeline to select multiple clips.
- **Copy Drag**: Hold `Ctrl` while dragging a clip to create a copy at the target position (the original clip remains unchanged; copying takes effect upon release).
- **Glue**: Right-click a clip and select "Glue" (requires at least 2 clips on the same track).
- **Split**: Select a clip and press `S` to split it at the playhead position.
- **Copy/Paste**: Select a clip and press `Ctrl + C` to copy it to the application clipboard. `Ctrl + V` aligns the leftmost start of the selected clips to the playhead position, preserving relative spacing.

Note that tracks support nesting: you can drag a track under another track to form a track group, which will be very useful during parameter adjustment.

### Parameter Panel

HiFiShifter's parameter panel provides operation support similar to VocalShifter for convenient parameter adjustment.

Note that there is a special `C` button on each track. Only when this button is pressed can audio on that track be processed by subsequent parameter adjustments.

During parameter adjustment, HiFiShifter operates on track groups. The root track's `C` button determines the algorithm and parameter curve shared by the entire group. The parameter curve applies to each audio clip based on its position.

Each algorithm in HiFiShifter offers different adjustable parameters; the common parameter is pitch.

When first opened, HiFiShifter takes some time to analyze the pitch of clips. After analysis, the solid line in the panel represents the group's current overall pitch, the dashed line represents the original overall pitch, and the colored lines represent each clip's own original pitch.

Other parameter panels are similar to the pitch panel but do not display individual clip original pitches.

The small eye icon next to a panel toggles its visibility when not selected.

### Algorithms

HiFiShifter currently supports three algorithms.

#### World Algorithm

A classic vocoder.  
Supports only `Pitch` editing.

#### PC-NSF-HiFiGAN

OpenVPI's open-source hifigan vocoder specialized for singing voices.  
Supports editing of `Pitch`, `Breath`, `Tension`, `Formant Shift`, and `Volume`.  
Note that breath editing requires additional enabling; it uses the hnsep UVR model for breath separation, which may take a long time on first use. If you need to edit tension, ensure breath is enabled.

#### Vslib

Algorithm library provided by VocalShifter.  
Supports editing of `Pitch`, `Pan`, `Formant Shift`, `Volume`, and `Breath`.  
Because the official DLL only supports file I/O, processing takes longer compared to VocalShifter itself.
